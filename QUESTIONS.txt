QUESTIONS:

HOW SHOULD GENRE AND RATING BE REPRESENTED? OBJECTS OR FIELDS???????

Should there be a CollectionOfAlbums & CollectionOfMovies that keeps track of the objects?
	Seems easier to just feed the lists (that would have been in these classes) directly to the view. Otherwise the point of db dissapears!
